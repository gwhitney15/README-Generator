  # README Generator

  ## Description:
 
  This project is used to easily construct a professional README

 -This project was built to save time when making a README file
 -This prevents the user from having to create a new README template every time they wish to make one.
 -The biggest challenges I faced with this project are learning to use arrow functions, promises, and node properly.
